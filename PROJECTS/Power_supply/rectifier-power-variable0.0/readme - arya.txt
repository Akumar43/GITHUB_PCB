for measure circuit open Measure_circuit\PCB\stepper_vibra_new   (proteus project) --- for understanding circuit --
 this would give error in simulation just look this for PCB design and schematics

for doing simulation on above code use Measure_circuit\Simulation\simuation(proteus project)

for checking the code open Measure_circuit\Simulation\MyProject.mccpi

i wanted to change my c code and follow some standard, i have done that in application.txt file in(Measure_circuit\Simulation)..
i have not compiled it yet..so try to make tht compilable and running.
